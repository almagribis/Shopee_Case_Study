# 🧠 AI Solution Engineer Case Study — Shopee

This repository contains a complete study case project for the AI Solution Engineer role at Shopee.
The repo is divided into three main modules:

1. 📓 Notebook — Engineering Knowledge Test and coding exercises (CSV parsing).
2. 🌿  Calyx — Local vector database implementation with cosine similarity and simple API.
3. 🦅 Aquila — AI Agent and Streamlit dashboard for analyzing food receipts.

Each folder includes its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions.

## 🧩 Module Overview
